# Featured-Products-Carousel
Explanation Of My Approach:

HTML Structure: I have created a basic HTML structure with a container, wrapper for slides, and navigation buttons.

Basic Styles (CSS): I have set up basic styles for the carousel to make it visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript Functionality: I have added simple JavaScript to handle manual navigation with arrow buttons and automatic rotation using the setInterval function.

Reasoning behind my Choices:

I have used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep it simple and accessible.
The approach ensures that the carousel works smoothly on various screen sizes and devices.
No external frameworks are used to make it easy to integrate into any web project
